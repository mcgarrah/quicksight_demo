# AWS Quicksight Demonstration

## Summary

A goal of this repository is to automate as much as possible from the above posts the manual steps in Terraform and convert the CloudFormation to Terraform where possible. Also, updating the Python Lambda layers and code to more current versions of libraries and runtimes is in scope as well.

This Quicksight Demo is based on the following AWS Business Intelligence Blog posts:

- [Federate Amazon QuickSight access with Okta](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-intelligence/federate-amazon-quicksight-access-with-okta/)

- [Sync users and groups from Okta with Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-intelligence/sync-users-and-groups-from-okta-with-amazon-quicksight/)

- [Tutorial: Amazon QuickSight and IAM identity federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/tutorial-okta-quicksight.html)

## TODO

TODO: Generate a list of manual steps required before and after running the Terraform.
